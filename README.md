🌸 Iris Flower Classification Web Application

This project is a Machine Learning–based Iris Flower Classification system built using Python and Flask.
The application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project was developed as a learning and portfolio project by a Computer Science undergraduate.

🧠 Machine Learning & Model Training

The Iris classification model is trained using supervised Machine Learning techniques on the famous Iris dataset.

Steps involved:

Dataset loading and preprocessing

Feature selection

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Model training using a classification algorithm

Trained model is saved as a .pkl file for prediction

⚠️ Note:
The trained model file (.pkl) is not included in this repository for security and best-practice reasons.
